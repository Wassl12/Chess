# A chess game, and hopefully a chess engine upon completion
# Uses classes in C++ to simulate a chess game for the user
# Currently has class definitions and very basic movement for some of the pieces
# Will add move verification to check legality of moves (needed in case of discovery checks)
# Will allow for two player or single player or spectator
