# A chess engine that uses alpha-beta pruning in order to pick proper moves
# Using a search depth of 8 or higher is highly recommended for traditional chess games. However, it is slow at this depth
# If you wish for a faster paced game, use a search depth of 7 or 6, but beware that the engine isn't very effective at shallow depths and you may have an easy time beating it
# To spectate the engine, type 's' when prompted for which side to use
